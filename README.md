This is a folder containing two projects. 
1) Berkeley Planner - a planner/reminder application using Swift for Berkeley students to better organize their time. Enjoy using!
2) Markov Chains as Predictors: Markov Chains: MarkovProcess class using python which allows the user to predict the transition between three market states: bull, bear, and stagnant. The implementation includes methods to find the stationary distribution vector, probability of A before B, and a random stream of transitions to find the most likely stream in a given period.
